# Samsung-Health-to-Garmin-conversion
Here is a Python script to convert your running exercises recorded on a Samsung device into Garmin TCX format.

Run it with Terminal, you will need to have a recent version of Python installed on your computer. A recent version of the lxml package is also needed.

Have a script saved in the exported folder of your Samsung Health Data.

This script only converts data with GPS information and only running activities. If you want to include other activities adjust code accordingly.

This code is modification of PhilippImhof's FromSamToGarm.
